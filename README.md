### Hi there! 🤘

😄 My name is Lucas Correia from São Paulo, Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Front-End Developer since 2019 and open source projects, is becoming a passion. I develop solutions in the form of software using my creativity and my technical knowledge in JavaScript.

❤️ I love building interfaces and web applications with React that is not only beautiful, but pleasant to use and really problem solving.

🚀 In addition, I create RESTful APIs using NodeJS that can handle large loads of requests and will never disappoint you.
