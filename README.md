:art: I develop solutions in the form of software using my creativity and my technical knowledge in JavaScript.

ðŸ˜„ I love building interfaces and web applications with React that is not only beautiful, but pleasant to use and really problem solving.

ðŸš€ In addition, I create RESTful APIs using NodeJS that can handle large loads of requests and will never disappoint you.
